White Board Algorithims

Please create solutions for the items below in JavaScript/Jquery

1.     Write an algorithm to create all the permutations of a string. e.g. given "ABC" you would return
[ "ABC", "ACB", "BAC", "BCA" etc.....]
2.     Write an algorithm to find the longest palindrome in a string e.g. given:
"ABCCBAZAAZQUERTYYTREUQFOXOX"  you would return "QUERTYYTREUQ"

3.     Write two algorithms...one to traverse a tree data structure width first and another to traverse a tree depth first.
4.     Write function to compute Nth Fibonacci number? Both iterative and recursive?
5.     You are given an array with integers between 1 and 1,000,000. One integer is in the array twice. How can you determine which one?
